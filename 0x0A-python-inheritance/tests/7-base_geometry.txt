How to Use 7-base_geometry.py
=============================

This modules defines a base geometry class BaseGeometry.

Instantiation
=============

``BaseGeometry`` includes no attributes, and accordingly is initialized 
with no arguments.

::

	>>> BaseGeometry = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry
	>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
	>>> type(bg)
	<class '7-base_geometry.BaseGeometry'>

::

	>>> print(bg) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
	<7-base_geometry.BaseGeometry object at ...>

In fact, any arguments supplied to an instantiation of ``BaseGeometry`` results
	in a TypeError.

::


Methods
=======

``BaseGeometry`` features two methods - ``area(self)`` and 
``integer_validator(self, name, value)``. ``area(...)`` is not yet
implemented.

::

	>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
	>>> print(bg.area) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
	<bound method BaseGeometry.area of <7-base_geometry.BaseGeometry 
	object at...>>

::

	>>> bg.area()
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	Exception: area() is not implemented
